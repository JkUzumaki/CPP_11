noexcept
~~~~~~~~
	The noexcept operator performs a compile time check that returns true if an expression is declared to not throw any exceptions.

It is used in two different ways:
	1. As specifier.
	2. As operator.
Note:
	It simply test if a function noexcept specification evaluates to true or false at compile time.

specifier:
~~~~~~~~~~
	It means the function marked with keyword noexcept must not throw exception. It throws exception, then program crashes.

	syntax:
		noexcept(const boolean expression)
		here,
			const boolean expression -> compile time expression
			noexcept(const boolean expression) is equivalent to noexcept(true)
			
Operator:
~~~~~~~~~
	It returns a operator dunction throws exception or not.
	
	syntax:
		noexcept (const expression)
		here,
			const expression -> compile time expression	
Note:
	Mostly noexcept is used when c++ function is used in c language.
